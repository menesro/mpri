15 - finish explaining the construction of the boolean programs 
20 - the refinement problem => introducing the concept of interpolation
20 - explaining interpolation for propositional logic => computation that uses an unsatisfiability proof (resolution is complete for refutation -> DPLL)
- how to do it over theories (we discuss only the quantifier-free case)
40 - the same idea, but we have to define the kind of proofs we consider => presenting SMT solvers
10 - show what needs to be adapted -> computing interpolants for theory axioms
